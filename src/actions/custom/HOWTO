Place your own_action.py in any of these folders.
These actions _must_ override ActionBase.

Some actions have higher priority than others, but this may change.
The reason why the folders aren't labeled as "priority0..n" is because
it's easier for us, humans, to understand what does each action like this.
Also, we all know insults come first.
