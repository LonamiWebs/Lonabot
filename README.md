# lonabots
several [dumbots](https://github.com/Lonami/dumbot) for telegram.

## current bots
* [@lonabot](https://t.me/lonabot) allows you to set reminders.
* [@textobot](https://t.me/textobot) allows you to alter your texts.

## running
1. download or `git clone` this repository.
2. create `botname.token` (e.g. `lonabot.token`).
3. run `python -m botname` (e.g. `python -m lonabot`).

## notes
you should use these bots as long as you trust the maintainer of the
server, since for obvious reasons, they have access to the stored data.
