# Lonabots
Several Python bots for Telegram.

## Current bots
* [@lonabot](https://t.me/lonabot), allows you to set reminders.
  You must `git clone --recursive` since it uses `dumbot` as a submodule.
* [@textobot](https://t.me/textobot), allows you to alter your texts.
  This one needs `python-telegram-bot` to be installed, for now.

## Notes
You should use these bots as long as you trust the maintainer of the server,
since for obvious reasons, they have access to the stored data.
