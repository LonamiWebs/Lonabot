# Lonabots
Several Python bots for Telegram, using the well-stabilised API
[python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot).

## Current bots
* [@lonabot](https://t.me/lonabot), allows you to set reminders.
* [@textobot](https://t.me/textobot), allows you to alter your texts.

## Notes
You should use these bots as long as you trust the maintainer of the server,
since for obvious reasons, they have access to the stored data.
